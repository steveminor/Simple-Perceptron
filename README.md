# Simple-Perceptron
This program is written in python and utilizes the pygame library.
This little program simulates the process of learning a single function. 
The program creates a line across the screen and fills the screen with several points.
The perceptron is created and must guess if each point is above or below the line.
If the perceptron guesses correctly and the point is above the line, then the point will be colored red.  
If the perceptron guesses correctly and the point is below the line, then the point will be colored green. 
If the perceptron is incorrect then the color of the point will be set to black
Every time the user presses the space bar, the perceptron will check which points it got wrong and then adjust its weights to make a new guess.
